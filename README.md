#### NOTE: Currently only `./local` is being developped. The `./web` dirrectory does not work yet.

`./Local` is the CLI as well as an express server that can be run optionally.

`./web` is a create-react-app and will serve as testing ground for the npm module that will interact with the express server in the CLI.
